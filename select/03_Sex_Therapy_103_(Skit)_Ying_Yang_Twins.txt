(Doctor Chris Olmen)
Ladies I'm just so impressed with you guys today.
Progress is really being made.
Now we getting ready to switch gears on the third question and this is:
What gets you in the mood, for sex?

(Girl # 2)
It's all about the 4-play
And 4-play is an all day event
Phone sex, e-mails whatever
Just some shit to make me want you that much more when I get home from work and step in the door lights out
Candles burnin' wit some Jodeci: Diary of a Mad Band
Rub me down all the way down
Tease me, bite me, suck me

(Girl # 1)
I'm like a motor in the winter
You gotta get me warmed up before you get me started
Tongue touching, body rubbing
And when we take it there,
Don't be afriad to taste both these lips

(Girl # 3)
Now I can't speak for them young girls but uh
We can do it anywhere:
In the car, on the lawn before dawn
Under the moon, at the beach
As long as it's sweet lil candlelight something soft and sexy
In the background you know a lil Keith Sweat, something that's got that boom in it
