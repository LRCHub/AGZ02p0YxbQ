My Beautiful Friend
I will pay attention don't say this is the end
I find it hard to describe you
To point and discover you
Could I tell you once again
O My Beautiful Friend
Let me sleep and I will feed you when you're hungry
4 Ever live inside of me
Thru the holes in the pockets of my clothes
High as high as an angel
I will stand there beside you
Love is all we need
My Beautiful Friend
My Beautiful Friend
I swear I adore you
Ain't no woman deep enough
I don't know how we made it this far dear
? C Without losing at least an ear
I could leave us, I could leave us a painting
Our lives are-a-changing
I couldn't and I wouldn't want to change you
Don't you know it I can save you
I will do all of this on my
VER-Y? COWN-
My Beautiful Friend
My Beautiful Friend
(Can I ask you) Do you ever get this feeling
When its hard to carry on
