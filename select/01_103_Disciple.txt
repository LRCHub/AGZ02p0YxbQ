Verse
Stained, wash me (Rev 1: 5)
As high as the heavens are above the earth
That's how far You've taken our sin from us (Psalm 103: 11)
As far as the east is from the west that is how far
That you have removed our transgression from us (Psalm 103: 12)

Chorus
And I will sing Hallelujah (Rev. 19: 1)
