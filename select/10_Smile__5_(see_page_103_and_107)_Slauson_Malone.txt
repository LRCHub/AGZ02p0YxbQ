Memories is medicine
But my past made me reticent
I really need me Ritalin
Or better yet, some Mescaline

'Cause the future's always tentative
Present's always relative
Like birthdays with my

They said these cards dealt
But life ain't a game
And I sure ain't a spade
And I sure ain't a SALVE!
And we sure ain't the same (But I wonder)

What makes god different, size and number?
All between a club and a clover
Looking for luck in them L.A. summers
I remember my mom in Dumb and Dumber
I remember near death in a rover
I remember when she got sober
Then, coped the same one in October
Same color, same color

Can't smile like the past when I see you
Mistake my past as I seen it
'Cause what it was ain't really what it seem
Maybe, pain is what I really mean
Or maybe gas what I really need
Too bad it turned me to a fiend
For weeks, dazed
(Oh mama)

I don't know
Where to go
Protect my soul
Before I ghost

I'm gone, I'm gone
I was lost, but I'm found (I think)

(Gas, what I smoke, nigga)
(Gas!)
(Gas)
